My final year project at the University of Manchester.

My project is to create a 2-D side scrolling platform game for Android devices. In my game the character will be able to run, jump and duck and the player will control the charatcer through a variety of levels, avoiding obstacles and defeating enemies. 

In order to develop my project I am creating my own artwork and building my own game engine, with the help of a very basic game development framework which is provided in James Cho's 'The beginners guide to Android Game Development'.
